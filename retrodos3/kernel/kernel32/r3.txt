R3.IMG : 1.44 MB (3.5") bootable floppy disk image (A:).
	It has Retro DOS v2 (& v3 compatible) boot sector
	which loads Retro DOS v3.2 kernel 'MSDOS.SYS'.

	Retro DOS v3.2 is like as (almost same with) MSDOS 3.3
	(because, origin of Retro DOS v3 is already MSDOS v3.3 kernel)
	but (also) it is able to use >32MB DOS (type 6, FAT 16) partitions.
