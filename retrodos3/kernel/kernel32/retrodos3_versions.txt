Retro DOS 3.? versions by Erdogan Tan
--------------------------------------

1) Retro DOS v3.0 - Rewritten MSDOS 3.3 kernel by Erdogan Tan in Istanbul
		    (in 2018 and then 2019 for modifications)
		    by using MSDOS 2.0, MSDOS 3.3 (BIOS), MSDOS 6.0
		    source code and disassembled MSDOS 3.3 kernel code.
		    !!! New (RETRO) kernel is nearly same with original
			MSDOS 3.3 kernel except minor modifications !!!
		    Retro DOS source code (assembly language) assembler
		    is NASM 2.11 (& 2.14) ..
		    .. but original MSDOS kernel code assembler was MASM.
	            
		     Major difference: Retro DOS boot sector code 
			 loads Retro DOS kernel as single binary/kernel file;
			 IO.SYS is a part of MSDOS.SYS (bios+sysinit+kernel).

2) Retro DOS v3.1 - Optimized code. Improved stack management (MSDOS 6.0) code. 
	            Smaller kernel file size. 
		    Buffers & 16 bit disk sector addresses are same with MSDOS 3.3.

3) Retro DOS v3.2 - 32 bit disk sector addresses (>32 MB disk/partition access)
	 	    as MSDOS 6.0 disk R&W source code but buffer management
	            is same with MSDOS 3.3. Other features are as MSDOS 3.3.

Kernel files:

MSDOS.SYS : 
	Kernel binary (RETRODOS.SYS), Retro DOS v2.0 (& v3.0) boot sector
	code loads and starts this kernel file (in root directory) at 1000:0000h
	then Retro DOS kernel moves itself to segment 0070h as IO.SYS (BIOS)
	and loads SYSINIT code (SYSINIT.BIN inside MSDOS.SYS) at top of memory
	and SYSINIT loads MSDOS kernel (MSDOS.BIN inside MSDOS.SYS) at the
	first proper location after BIOS (IO.SYS) code and data. 	 	 

retrodos3.asm : 
	Main file (equivalent of IO.SYS, includes SYSNIT, MSDOS.SYS binaries) 
	(Assembler adds included binary files to assembled retrodos.asm code.)

sysinit2.asm :
	SYSINIT code. It is written as a seperate asm file because of SYSINIT
	segment is different and SYSINIT code starts from offset 0.	 
	(It is assembled seperately then SYSINIT.BIN is added to single kernel file.)
	
msdos3.asm : 
	Kernel file (MSDOS.SYS file of MSDOS 3.3).
	It is written as a seperate asm file because of MSDOS kernel (MSDOS.SYS)
	segment is different than BIOS (IO.SYS) segment.
	(It is assembled seperately then MSDOS.BIN is added to single kernel file.)

Assembler usage:
	nasm sysinit2.asm  -l sysinit2.txt  -o SYSINIT2.BIN -Zerror.txt
	nasm msdos3.asm    -l msdos3.txt    -o MSDOS3.BIN   -Zerror.txt
	nasm retrodos3.asm -l retrodos3.txt -o MSDOS.SYS    -Zerror.txt

	Note: SYSINIT2.BIN and MSDOS3.BIN binary files are included by RETRODOS3.ASM
	      (by using 'INCBIN' directive of NASM)
	      * SYSINIT2.ASM uses some fixed (equ) addresses in binary output of
	        RETRODOS3.ASM as shown addresses in RETRODOS3.TXT.
	      * RETRODOS3.ASM uses some fixed (equ) addresses in binary output of
		SYSINIT2.ASM as	shown addresses in SYSINIT2.TXT.

Emulator usage:
	Floppy disk and hard disk image file (with Retro DOS v2.0 & v3.0 boot sector)
	is mounted as Windows (XP,7,10) drive (floppy or hard disk) and then
	MSDOS.SYS (Retro DOS v3.? kernel) file is copied onto root directory of 
	that virtual disk drive. (For example: 'R3.IMG' as 1.44MB floppy disk image.)
	And then original MSDOS 3.3 or Retro DOS v3.0 COMMAND.COM file is copied onto
	root directory of same disk image.
	And required (MSDOS 3.3 compatible) files and programs are copied onto same or
	another disk image which will be used with emulator program (mounted image
 	must be unmounted before using it in emulator).

Emulator programs (for running Retro DOS v3.?) :
	BOCHS, VIRTUAL BOX, QEMU etc. 

Using Retro DOS kernel on real computer:
	Retro DOS v3.? will run on a real IBM PC AT compatible computer if it has a
	standard floppy disk drive or it has a standard ATA (PATA) harddisk 
	which contains MSDOS partition (FAT12 or FAT16 CHS file system) at (in) 
	the 1st 32 MB of the disk. But the boot disk must be formatted or boot sector 
	must be updated by Retro DOS v2.0 (v3.0) format (or boot sector updating) 
	utility before copying kernel file and COMMAND.COM file onto root directory
	of the primary (and active) MSDOS partition.

	Retro DOS v3.? floppy disk image (for example: 'R3.IMG' file) must be written onto
	a real 1.44MB floppy disk (by using 'rawwrite' or similar 'image to disk' program).
	And the computer must be restarted/rebooted with that floppy disk.

	(To use bootable hard disk is possible but booting by floppy disk is very easy for
	 testing Retro DOS v3.? kernel.)

	If Retro DOS 3 is started by floppy disk boot..
	   It recognises primary DOS partitions (1,4 for v3.0/v3.1 and 1,4,6 for v3.2)
	   Only the boot drive must have Retro DOS boot sector, Retro DOS (MSDOS.SYS)
	   kernel and MSDOS 3.3 or Retro DOS v3.0 COMMAND.COM command interpreter file.
	   It will be enough if other disks are any kind of MSDOS 3.3 compatible.
