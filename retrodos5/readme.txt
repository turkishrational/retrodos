Retro DOS v5.0 (Modified PCDOS 7.1) Source Code (Not ready yet...) 27/12/2023 - Erdogan Tan
Last Update: 4/5/2024 (bootable disk image, IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM source code, retrodos5.s, PCDOS.SYS, boot sectors, installation/format programs) 

*** Tested on a Real Computer (runs Windows 7) with a disk contains FAT32 and FAT16 logical drives on extended dos partition) ****
((Retro DOS v5 recognizes all of logical -FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32- DOS drives in an extended dos partition and on USB -external- disks.. in addition to primary FAT32, FAT16, FAT12 dos partitions))
Windows 3.1 and AutoCAD R12 is running on Retro DOS v5 (on the Real Cumputer) without a problem (but QEMU has a problem with Windows 3.1 MSDOS prompt)
