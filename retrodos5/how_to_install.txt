How Retro DOS v5 can be installed?
----------------------------------
Remember: It will run as (modified, bugfixed) IBM PCDOS 7.1.

Answers:
(to see command/utility usage summary write these commands on dos prompt
 without any argument. For example: "A:\RETRODOS>RD5HDIMG".)
 
0) New Hard (or Floppy) Disk Image
	RD5HDIMG.COM HARDDISKIMAGENAME(.IMG) -to create hard disk image file-
	RD5FDIMG.COM FLOPPYDISKIMAGENAME(.IMG) -to create floppy disk img file-	

        (raw disk images are created, later they can be converted to other types)

	DOSBOX, DOS or 32 bit Windows can be used to creating disk images.
        (Emulators are also proper to create disk image file. Then, the image file
        must be copied to Windows or Linux volume in order to use with an emulator.)

        (Operating system must recognize virtual disk image which contains
         the created raw disk image. For example: IMGDISK program is proper
         for Windows 7-11 for that purpose. Or mounting a Windows directory
         as virtual disk is an alternative method for QEMU and VIRTUALBOX.)

Note: RAWWRITEWIN.EXE or another program (IMG2FD.COM, FD2IMG.COM etc.) can be used
      to write disk image to physical floppy disk or reverse.
      DISKGENIUS can be used to handling hard disk images (HD2IMG or IMG2HD). 	  
		
1) Disk Image (for Emulator)
   Needed: R5.IMG (Retro DOS v5) floppy disk image or
           32 MB (Retro DOS v5 bootable, RD5HD32.IMG) hard disk image with
           (for example, in \RETRODOS directory) those installation files:
           a) R5HDFORM.COM ; Formats FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 partition for Retro DOS v5
           b) FDISK3R5.COM ; Displays, Creates, Deletes, Changes MSDOS partitions
           c) R5HDBOOT.COM ; Updates MSDOS partition's volume boot sector
                          to Retro DOS v5 boot sector (Kernel file: PCDOS.SYS)
           a and c are alternatives.
           b is used if there is not a DOS partition on/in the virtual harddisk.

           (If the format option is used, another formatting is not needed after
            FDISK3R5.COM. Only needing: to copy PCDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM.) 

	   ***
    After formatting (or updating the boot sector):
          copy PCDOS.SYS (kernel file) to the formatted disk/volume -must be C:-
          copy COMMAND.COM (command interpreter) to root dir of the formatted disk.
	 
          NOTE: Disk image can be formatted as C: or D: then
                it can be used as C: 
                (depending on configuration of QEMU, BOCHS, VIRTUALBOX)

2) Real Computer:
   A DOS disk (recognized by ROMBIOS) must contain or must be proper to create
   a FAT32 (or FAT16 or FAT12) primary dos partition. .. with those files:

	a) FDISK3R5.COM (<= 502GB hard disk partitioning, 65535 cylinders limit)
           or FDISK4R5.COM (2TB disk partitioning, 32 bit -virtual- cylinder numbers)
	   -MBR type partition tables-
           is used to DISPLAY, CREATE, DELETE, CHANGE primary DOS partition.
        b) R5HDFORM.COM is used to formatting existing MSDOS or WINDOWS
           (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32) partition/volume. (C: or D: or hard disk number
            and partition number must be defined as command option.)

          ((R5FDFORM.COM, IMG2FD.COM or RAWWRITEWIN.EXE
            can be used to prepare Retro DOS v5 -PCDOS 7.1- boot floppy.))
 
	(If the format option is used, another formatting is not needed after
            FDISK. Only needing: to copy PCDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM to the root
            directory of the new C:.)

	((using/running above commands/utilities without a file or a disk name
          gives usage information -short 'how to use' help-.))

	If FAT or FAT32 volume is existing..
           R5HDBOOT.COM (boot sector updater) can be used instead of R5HDFORM.COM.
	
	Retro DOS v5 boot sector loads the kernel file PCDOS.SYS at once.
        (So, only needing is to write -proper type of- Retro DOS v5 boot sector
         and copy PCDOS.SYS into the root directory of the boot disk. Of course,
         COMMAND.COM must be copied to the root directory.)

	Which COMMAND.COM: PCDOS 7.1 COMMAND.COM or equivalent 4DOS.	
   
   NOTE: If Retro DOS v5 is started with a Floppy Disk or with a USB disk..
         No need to install Retro DOS on/into the internal/fixed disk.
         Retro DOS 5 can run normally with all recognized disks including
         all FAT or FAT32 logical disks in the extended DOS partition.
         (Windows -FAT32-, FreeDOS, MSDOS volumes can be used with RetroDOS.)

3) Changing IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM files of existing PCDOS 7.0, 7.1 volume
   with Retro DOS v5 IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM.
   (existing within Retro DOS v5 source code) 
   If disk/volume is a PCDOS 7.0 volume.. PCDOS 7.1 COMMAND.COM must be copied
   into the root directory of the PCDOS 7.0 volume/disk.
   (Also other needed PCDOS 7.1 files/utilities can be copied from a PCDOS 7.1
    boot floppy which is existing within Retro DOS v5 source code
    and in the sample R5 bootable disk images.)
   
    A sample floppy disk image: (1.44MB, 3.5")
      boot119p.ima (Retro DOS 5.0).. boot119.ima (original PCDOS 7.1). 
      -IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM must be copied without deleting,
       overwrite method is needed, because the 1st 2 root directory entries
       must be IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM in order/sequence!..
       deleting may change/spoil this condition.-
