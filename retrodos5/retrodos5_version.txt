Retro DOS 5.0 - Modified PCDOS 7.1 Kernel by Erdogan Tan
--------------------------------------------------------
JULY 2024 - Istanbul

Retro DOS v5.0 Kernel (PCDOS.SYS) is based on disassembled source code
of IBM PCDOS 7.1 IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM.

(But Retro DOS v5 kernel source code reference/construction is based on
on Retro DOS v4.2 kernel source code which is derived from 
original MSDOS 6.0 source code and disassembled MSDOS 6.22 kernel code.)

Retro DOS v5 boot sector(s) is different (original code) 
than IBM PCDOS 7.1 boot sector(s). It loads combined 'PCDOS.SYS' kernel
at once. (While IBM PCDOS 7.1 boot sector loads the 1st 4 sectors of
IBMBIO.COM -this is same with MSLOAD section of MSDOS IO.SYS-.)

****

Retro DOS v5 Kernel is as a compact and modified PCDOS 7.1 kernel.
(Kernel File Name: PCDOS.SYS -for using/loading by Retro DOS v5 boot sector-)
It is as an update of PCDOS 7.1 kernel with important bugfixes.

(NOTE: There are also -Retro DOS v5- IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM kernel files
usable with IBM PCDOS boot sector.)

((Original PCDOS 7.1 COMMAND.COM is needed for now.))
(((I will write/develop Retro DOS v5 COMMAND.COM later, in 2024.)))

****

Retro DOS v5.0 combined kernel PCDOS.SYS (10/07/2024)
                               file size is 81366 bytes ..
               PCDOS 7.1 IBMBIO.COM + IBMDOS.COM total file size is 87222 bytes.

There are not any PCDOS 7.1 features removed...
Retro DOS v5 = PCDOS 7.1+. (Only optimized and bugfixed code.)

(9 PCDOS 7.1 kernel bugs -not exist in MSDOS kernel- are fixed in Retro DOS v5.
Also 1 MSDOS/PCDOS bug is fixed.)

****

Retro DOS v5 PCDOS.SYS (10/07/2024)
             runs Windows with "win /s" switch and on FAT16 fs 

(but Windows File Manager recognises FAT32 fs disk 
even if it can not started on FAT32 fs.)

AutoCAD R12 runs on Retro DOS v5 kernel (on FAT32 or FAT16 disk whatever)
	(after running mouse.com or mouse driver).

STACKER and DRVSPACE (disk compression) is usable with Retro DOS v5 kernel.
	(Just as PCDOS 7.1)

Retro DOS v5 PCDOS.SYS is almost a PCDOS 7.1 kernel
       (+ more compact and really bugfixed update of PCDOS 7.1 kernel)
